# form_mvc_pattern

A simple form performs all the crud operations (create, delete, update and read)
I've used the pdo in order to connect to the database **(mysql)**

I've used the **world database** you can download it from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html)<br>
And also the **MVC pattern** to structure my website files,<br>
**Bootstrap 5** for styling.

That's all, Hope that you'll learn something :)"
